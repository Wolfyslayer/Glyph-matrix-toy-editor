 *
 * Main editor screen composable for the Glyph Matrix Toy Editor.
 *
 * This composable will serve as the primary editing interface, combining
 * the matrix canvas, widget panel, and timeline bar into a cohesive
 * pixel art animation editing experience.
 *
 * Future implementation will include:
 * - Layout composition of MatrixCanvas, WidgetPanel, and TimelineBar
 * - State management for editor mode (draw, erase, select, etc.)
 * - Undo/redo functionality integration
 * - Tool selection and configuration UI
 * - Zoom and pan controls for the canvas
